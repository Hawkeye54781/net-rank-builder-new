# ✅ Docker Local Development Setup Complete!

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Environment Configuration**
- ✅ `.env` now points to **local Docker** (`http://127.0.0.1:54321`)
- ✅ `.env.production` saved production credentials
- ✅ `.env.test` saved cloud test credentials (backup)
- ✅ `.env.example` updated with Docker setup as default

### 2. **Database**
- ✅ Local Supabase started with Docker
- ✅ All migrations applied (including new profile creation trigger)
- ✅ Fresh database ready for development

### 3. **Documentation**
- ✅ `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` updated for Docker workflow
- ✅ New migration created: `20251009091120_handle_new_user_profile.sql`
  - Automatically creates user profiles on signup
  - Handles edge cases (missing club_id, etc.)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Restart Your Dev Server
```powershell
# Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then start fresh:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Sign Up
1. Open http://localhost:5173 (or your dev port)
2. Sign up with a new account
3. Profile should be created automatically!

### 3. Explore Local Supabase Studio
Open http://127.0.0.1:54323 in your browser to:
- View tables and data
- Run SQL queries
- Check auth users
- Monitor logs

## 🎯 Benefits of Docker Setup

✅ **Free & Fast** - No network latency, unlimited usage
✅ **Isolated** - Your production data is 100% safe
✅ **Resettable** - Use `supabase db reset` anytime for fresh start
✅ **Offline** - Develop without internet connection
✅ **Professional** - Industry-standard setup

## 📝 Common Commands

```powershell
# Start Supabase (if stopped)
supabase start

# Stop Supabase (frees up Docker resources)
supabase stop

# Reset database (fresh start with all migrations)
supabase db reset

# Check status
supabase status

# View logs
supabase logs
```

## 🔧 When You're Ready to Deploy

1. Link to production:
   ```powershell
   supabase link --project-ref kpizlvfvwazvpkuncxfq
   ```

2. Apply migrations:
   ```powershell
   supabase db push
   ```

3. Build and deploy your app with production credentials

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Docker must be running** for local dev to work
- **Local data** is separate from production (safe to experiment!)
- **Profile creation trigger** is now in migrations (will be applied to production when you push)

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your development environment is now professionally configured with:
- Local Docker development
- Production cloud database
- Automatic profile creation on signup
- Clean separation of environments

Happy coding! 🎾
