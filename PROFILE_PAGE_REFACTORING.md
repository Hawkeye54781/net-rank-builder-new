# User Profile Page Refactoring

## Overview
This refactoring creates a dedicated User Profile page and removes clutter from the Dashboard to improve mobile UX and overall user experience.

## What Changed

### ✅ New Features

#### 1. **User Profile Page** (`src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`)
A comprehensive profile page featuring:

**Header Section:**
- User avatar (initials in circular badge with gradient)
- Full name and club information
- Club rank badge (e.g., "Club Rank #3 of 25")
- Membership date badge

**Stats Cards:**
- ELO Rating with club rank
- Total matches played
- Win rate percentage with W-L record
- Number of ladders participating in

**Two Tabs:**
1. **Match History Tab** (default):
   - All recent matches
   - Record Match button
   - Reuses the MatchList component
   - Auto-refreshes after recording a match

2. **My Ladders Tab**:
   - Shows all ladders user is participating in
   - Displays ladder status (Active/Inactive)
   - Shows join date for each ladder
   - Clickable to navigate to ladder details
   - Empty state with "Browse Ladders" button

### ✅ Dashboard Changes

#### Removed:
- **4 stat cards** (ELO Rating, Matches Played, Win Rate, Active Ladders)
- **Recent Matches tab** (moved to profile)
- Unused imports and variables

#### Added:
- **Profile button** in header (ghost button with user icon)
  - Desktop: Shows "Profile" text
  - Mobile: Icon only
- Cleaner, more focused interface

#### Updated:
- Tab navigation now has 2-3 tabs instead of 3-4:
  - Regular users: Ladders, Rankings
  - Admins: Ladders, Rankings, Admin
- Welcome message removed for cleaner header

### ✅ LadderDetails Page Changes

#### Added:
- **Profile button** in header (consistent with Dashboard)
- Same responsive behavior (icon-only on mobile)

### ✅ Routing Updates

**New Routes:**
- `/profile` - User Profile page

**Route Handling:**
- Index page now handles routing logic
- Checks URL pathname to render appropriate component
- Same authentication flow maintained

## File Changes

### New Files
1. `src/pages/UserProfile.tsx` - Complete user profile page

### Modified Files
1. `src/App.tsx` - Added profile route
2. `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Added routing logic for profile
3. `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed stats, added profile button
4. `src/pages/LadderDetails.tsx` - Added profile button

## Benefits

### Mobile UX Improvements
✅ **Less scrolling** - Dashboard is much shorter without stat cards
✅ **Clearer navigation** - Dedicated profile page for personal stats
✅ **Focused experience** - Dashboard focuses on ladders and rankings
✅ **Better organization** - Personal data separated from club data

### Desktop UX Improvements

✅ **Logical separation** - Personal stats vs club activities
✅ **Easy access** - Profile button always visible in header

### Code Quality

## User Journey

### Accessing Profile
1. From Dashboard: Click "Profile" button in header
2. From Ladder Details: Click "Profile" button in header
3. Direct URL: Navigate to `/profile`

### Profile Page Features
- View all personal statistics at a glance
- Record new matches directly from profile
- See match history with ELO changes
- View and navigate to all participating ladders
- Quick return to Dashboard via "Back" button

## Mobile Responsive Features

### Profile Page
- **Header**: Avatar and info stack vertically on mobile
- **Stats cards**: 2-column grid on mobile, 4-column on desktop
- **Tabs**: Full-width with proper touch targets
- **Ladder cards**: Compact layout with truncated text

### Profile Button
- **Desktop**: Full button with icon + "Profile" text
- **Mobile**: Icon-only button (more space-efficient)
- **Consistent**: Same behavior on Dashboard and Ladder Details

## Technical Details

### Component Props
```typescript
interface UserProfileProps {
  user: User;
  onSignOut: () => void;
}
```

### State Management
- Fetches profile, club, rankings, and participating ladders
- Calculates club rank dynamically
